        The town of Ogbomoso lies between Ilorin and Oyo Town in the south
        western region of Nigeria. The town was founded in the mid-17th century
        by Ogunlola, a brave hunter of Ibariba descent. History has it that
        Ogunlola migrated to the present site of Ogbomoso around 1650 in pursuit
        of his hunting career. He arrived at the site which was then a dense
        jungle with his wife named Esuu and together they camped beneath an
        ajagbon tree which can still be seen today near the Soun’s palace. Later
        on, Ogunlola and his wife built a hut near the tree and settled there
        permanently.

        Shortly after they settled in the jungle, Ogunlola noticed that smoke
        emit daily from nearby places. He decided to check the places out and to
        his surprise, he discovered that four other hunters were also dwelling
        in the jungle. The first hunter was a Nupe elephant hunter named Aale
        who camped in a place now known as Oke-Elerin (Elephant Hill). The
        second was an Otta prince named Onisile who left his town because of
        title dispute, he settled in a place now known as Ijeru. The third
        hunter was Orisatolu who camped at Isapa and the last hunter settled at
        Akande which no longer exist. Ogunlola established his dominance over
        the four hunters with his unmatched hunting skills and the help of his
        wife, Esuu, who was very good at making tobacco snuff and guinea
        corn-wine which the hunters liked so much.

        Ogunlola and the hunters formed a society called Alongo with the aims of
        protecting the settlement from slave raiders, hunting wild animals
        together, helping one another and so on. The settlement began to expand
        as people moved in till it became a village. Ogunlola gradually became
        the head of the new village as his hut became the administrative center
        where important issues were discussed, and a court where disputes were
        settled.

        The history of Ogbomoso has it that Ogunlola was later imprisoned at
        Oyo-Ile, the capital of the old Oyo empire, for an alleged crime. While
        in prison, Ogunlola heard about a warrior named Elemoso who had been
        terrorising Oyo-Ile. He pleaded with the Alaafin (traditional ruler of
        Oyo) to let him out of the prison to fight and kill Elemoso. After much
        persuasion, the Alaafin granted Ogunlola’s request to hunt Elemoso down.

        Elemoso was a very strong and brave warrior who fought with sword and
        arrows. Ogunlola was shown Elemoso’s camp. However, it took him some
        days to study Elemoso’s tactics. One night, Ogunlola crept upon
        Elemoso’s camp and shot him down with an arrow. He beheaded him and took
        his head to the Alaafin who was very happy. The Alaafin granted Ogunlola
        freedom and even persuaded him to stay in Oyo-Ile but Ogunlola refused,
        he said to the Alaafin: “Ejé kí á ma se óhún” meaning “Let me stay
        faraway in my land“. This is where the title ‘Soun‘, the traditional
        ruler of Ogbomoso, was coined from.

        Ogunlola returned to his village and was made the paramount leader with
        the title of Soun. He became the first Soun of Ogbomoso. The settlement
        was subsequently called “Eyi ti Ogbori Elemoso” meaning “the one who
        carried Elemoso’s head“. This was shortened to Ogbori Elemoso and later,
        Ogbomoso which it is called till today. This was how Ogbomoso got it’s
        name from Ogunlola’s bravery. Ogbomoso later rose from its mere village
        status to a strong town due to the role it subsequently played in the
        history of Yoruba land.
