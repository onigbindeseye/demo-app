            We help organisations and governments, capture a comprehensive and
            accurate perspective of carbon footprints. Calculating your
            companyâ€™s carbon footprint means determining the amount of emissions
            it emits into the atmosphere. This is the first step in the entire
            offsetting process: by purchasing carbon credits, you can finance
            projects that aim to absorb these emissions, effectively achieving
            carbon neutrality.
